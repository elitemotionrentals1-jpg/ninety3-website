# 📸 Identify & Rename Your Images

Based on what I see in your folder, here's what you have:

## Your Current Images:

1. **NINETY3.jpg** (24KB) - This is likely your **LOGO**
2. **BLACKSAMPLE.jpg** (46KB) - This is likely the **Black SENTIZERO tracksuit**
3. **OGSAMPLE93.jpg** (75KB) - Possibly another product image
4. **IMG_9992.JPEG** through **IMG_9997.JPEG** - These might be:
   - Person wearing green tracksuit
   - Product photos
   - Other brand images

## What the Website Needs:

1. `logo.png` - Your Ninety3 cursive logo
2. `person-green-tracksuit.jpg` - Person wearing dark green tracksuit
3. `black-sentizero-tracksuit.jpg` - Black SENTIZERO tracksuit (full set)
4. `black-sentizero-hoodie.jpg` - Black SENTIZERO hoodie only
5. `black-sentizero-pants.jpg` - Black SENTIZERO sweatpants only

## Next Steps:

I'll help you rename them! Let me know which image is which, or I can help you:
1. Look at each image to identify it
2. Rename them to match what's needed
3. Push everything to GitHub
4. Deploy your website!

**Tell me which image is which, or I can create copies with the right names!**
